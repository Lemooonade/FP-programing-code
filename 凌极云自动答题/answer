The "school" is a new project. It is called "City-as-School" and the name means just that: the city itself is the place where 350 students, between the ages of 15 and 18, learn their lessons.</p><p>Students choose areas of work which interest them and then they help to do that work. For instance, one girl spends her week in the office of a Congresswoman, helping the public with problems such as pensions, housing, etc. Then she goes to help in a theatre for a day and she spends one day a week taking first-year courses at college.</p><p>City-as-School is six years old. The education system in New York accepts it now, as an alternative to final years at school. But can it replace ordinary lessons? Students have to pass maths and science exams before they enter the "school". These subjects are not easy to provide for in "City-as-School". Teachers monitor the progress of the students. 80% to 85% of the students go to college after their time at "City-as-School". The success rate is high. And the students are enthusiastic about their "school". They like the responsibility of their work, and the sense of purpose it gives them. And they do know a lot about different kinds of work in the city!</p><lcw-question-view index="28"><span class="question-index">28. </span><div class="question-body">What does the school teach students to do? <lcw-anchor-view id="c0607711bdbc4085a9aced92fda6528d_0" display-name="(56)"></lcw-anchor-view><lcw-choice-reply-answer ref-branches="4956ee056df0429c900630aa97f532d5" index="0" duration="15000" display-name="(56)"></lcw-choice-reply-answer><br /><lcw-branches-answer mode="single" id="4956ee056df0429c900630aa97f532d5" columns="0"><lcw-branch index="A" value="1">It teaches students to choose areas of work which interest them.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="B" value="2">It teaches students to know a lot about different kinds of work in the city.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="C" value="4">It teaches students how to go to college.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="D" value="8">It teaches students how to pass exams.</lcw-branch></lcw-branches-answer></div></lcw-question-view><lcw-question-view index="29"><span class="question-index">29. </span><div class="question-body">Why do students have to pass maths and science exams before they enter the school? <lcw-anchor-view id="c0607711bdbc4085a9aced92fda6528d_1" display-name="(57)"></lcw-anchor-view><lcw-choice-reply-answer ref-branches="8a28a65626434b388a2dfc6d1d5bfcf8" index="1" duration="15000" display-name="(57)"></lcw-choice-reply-answer><br /><lcw-branches-answer mode="single" id="8a28a65626434b388a2dfc6d1d5bfcf8" columns="0"><lcw-branch index="A" value="1">They take first-year courses at college after entering the school.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="B" value="2">These subjects are not easy to provide for in the school.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="C" value="4">These subjects are difficult to learn.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="D" value="8">They are given lessons.</lcw-branch></lcw-branches-answer></div></lcw-question-view><lcw-question-view index="30"><span class="question-index">30. </span><div class="question-body">What feeling do the students have for the school? <lcw-anchor-view id="c0607711bdbc4085a9aced92fda6528d_2" display-name="(58)"></lcw-anchor-view><lcw-choice-reply-answer ref-branches="53b574d69ade4c4491de153cb060d960" index="2" duration="15000" display-name="(58)"></lcw-choice-reply-answer><br /><lcw-branches-answer mode="single" id="53b574d69ade4c4491de153cb060d960" columns="0"><lcw-branch index="A" value="1">They are full of enthusiasm for it.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="B" value="2">They regard it as the best.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="C" value="4">They are interested in it.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="D" value="8">They dislike it.</lcw-branch></lcw-branches-answer></div></lcw-question-view><lcw-question-view index="31"><span class="question-index">31. </span><div class="question-body">How many students can't go to college after their time at the school? <lcw-anchor-view id="c0607711bdbc4085a9aced92fda6528d_3" display-name="(59)"></lcw-anchor-view><lcw-choice-reply-answer ref-branches="df921127fc8a45a48978e3435ba35efa" index="3" duration="15000" display-name="(59)"></lcw-choice-reply-answer><br /><lcw-branches-answer mode="single" id="df921127fc8a45a48978e3435ba35efa" columns="0"><lcw-branch index="A" value="1">15% to 20% of the students.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="B" value="2">80% to 85% of the students.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="C" value="4">Quite a few.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="D" value="8">Not mentioned.</lcw-branch></lcw-branches-answer></div></lcw-question-view><lcw-question-view index="32"><span class="question-index">32. </span><div class="question-body">Which of the following is true according to the passage? <lcw-anchor-view id="c0607711bdbc4085a9aced92fda6528d_4" display-name="(60)"></lcw-anchor-view><lcw-choice-reply-answer ref-branches="7dabe1c08a724c7aba27d5dbbe8138fb" index="4" duration="15000" display-name="(60)"></lcw-choice-reply-answer><br /><lcw-branches-answer mode="single" id="7dabe1c08a724c7aba27d5dbbe8138fb" columns="0"><lcw-branch index="A" value="1">Students in "City-as-School" do not have any lessons.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="B" value="2">Students in "City-as-School" are university dropouts.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="C" value="4">"City-as-School" is a project which has proved successful in many cities.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="D" value="8">Students in "City-as-School" learn most from the society.</lcw-branch></lcw-branches-answer></div></lcw-question-view></lcw-item-view><hr class="lcw-item-separator" /><lcw-item-view id="b296e8bd18c04ca9b68597aa90453fd7" copyright="Â©LINDGE Sofrware Limited Company" source-id="98a48cc0-b383-46d1-b3f7-b5cebe21cd4c"><p>To understand how Americans think about something, it is necessary to understand "the point". Americans mention it often: "Let's get right to the point", they will say. "My point is ..." , "What's the point of all this?"</p><p>The "point" is the idea or piece of information that Americans suppose is, or should be, at the center of people's thinking, writings, and spoken comments. Speakers and writers are supposed to "make their points clear" , meaning that they are supposed to say or write clearly the idea or piece of information they wish to express.</p><p>People from many other cultures have different ideas about the point. Africans traditionally tell stories that express the thoughts they have in mind, rather than stating "the point" clearly. Japanese speak indirectly, leaving listeners to figure out what the point is. Thus, while an American might say to a friend, "I don't think that coat goes very well with the rest of your outfit" , a Japanese might say, "Maybe this other coat would look even better than the one you have on". Americans value a person who "gets right to the point", while the Japanese are likely to consider such a person insensitive if not rude.</p><p>The Chinese and Japanese languages are featured by vagueness and ambiguity. The clearness and directness Americans associate with "the point" cannot be achieved in Chinese and Japanese. Speakers of those languages thus have to learn a new way of reasoning and expressing their ideas if they are going to communicate satisfactorily with Americans.</p><lcw-question-view index="33"><span class="question-index">33. </span><div class="question-body">According to the passage, Americans expect speakers and writers to <lcw-anchor-view id="b296e8bd18c04ca9b68597aa90453fd7_0" display-name="(61)"></lcw-anchor-view><lcw-choice-reply-answer ref-branches="8d77dfce370f47b8b14b284b718dd40f" index="0" duration="15000" display-name="(61)"></lcw-choice-reply-answer>.<br /><lcw-branches-answer mode="single" id="8d77dfce370f47b8b14b284b718dd40f" columns="0"><lcw-branch index="A" value="1">express their personal views indirectly</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="B" value="2">be clear about their main ideas</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="C" value="4">give information in details</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="D" value="8">be honest about their true feelings</lcw-branch></lcw-branches-answer></div></lcw-question-view><lcw-question-view index="34"><span class="question-index">34. </span><div class="question-body">Which of the following peoples will tell a story to express what they have in mind? <lcw-anchor-view id="b296e8bd18c04ca9b68597aa90453fd7_1" display-name="(62)"></lcw-anchor-view><lcw-choice-reply-answer ref-branches="c226bd5cb52c411ea69cc71015ab258e" index="1" duration="15000" display-name="(62)"></lcw-choice-reply-answer><br /><lcw-branches-answer mode="single" id="c226bd5cb52c411ea69cc71015ab258e" columns="0"><lcw-branch index="A" value="1">Africans</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="B" value="2">Chinese.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="C" value="4">Americans</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="D" value="8">Japanese.</lcw-branch></lcw-branches-answer></div></lcw-question-view><lcw-question-view index="35"><span class="question-index">35. </span><div class="question-body">In the sentence "I don't think that coat goes very well with the rest of your outfit", what does the word "outfit" most probably mean? <lcw-anchor-view id="b296e8bd18c04ca9b68597aa90453fd7_2" display-name="(63)"></lcw-anchor-view><lcw-choice-reply-answer ref-branches="53797eb5d3644411b341882b045dd0dc" index="2" duration="15000" display-name="(63)"></lcw-choice-reply-answer><br /><lcw-branches-answer mode="single" id="53797eb5d3644411b341882b045dd0dc" columns="0"><lcw-branch index="A" value="1">Unit</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="B" value="2">Organization.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="C" value="4">Gear</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="D" value="8">Clothes.</lcw-branch></lcw-branches-answer></div></lcw-question-view><lcw-question-view index="36"><span class="question-index">36. </span><div class="question-body">According to the passage, the Japanese may consider it unacceptable to be <lcw-anchor-view id="b296e8bd18c04ca9b68597aa90453fd7_3" display-name="(64)"></lcw-anchor-view><lcw-choice-reply-answer ref-branches="59d10fb974f240359478da41161d2aa3" index="3" duration="15000" display-name="(64)"></lcw-choice-reply-answer>.<br /><lcw-branches-answer mode="single" id="59d10fb974f240359478da41161d2aa3" columns="0"><lcw-branch index="A" value="1">indirect</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="B" value="2">talkative</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="C" value="4">straightforward</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="D" value="8">curious</lcw-branch></lcw-branches-answer></div></lcw-question-view><lcw-question-view index="37"><span class="question-index">37. </span><div class="question-body">What should speakers of Chinese do in order to communicate with Americans satisfactorily? <lcw-anchor-view id="b296e8bd18c04ca9b68597aa90453fd7_4" display-name="(65)"></lcw-anchor-view><lcw-choice-reply-answer ref-branches="36635dd57400413888a7d19b37bdb4d2" index="4" duration="15000" display-name="(65)"></lcw-choice-reply-answer><br /><lcw-branches-answer mode="single" id="36635dd57400413888a7d19b37bdb4d2" columns="0"><lcw-branch index="A" value="1">To pay attention to their pronunciation.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="B" value="2">To change their way of thinking.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="C" value="4">To be careful about their choice of words.</lcw-branch><lcw-branch index="D" value="8">To speak English fluently.</lcw-branch></lcw-branches-answer></div></lcw-question-view></lcw-item-view></lcw-item-group></lcw-width-sizing-view></lcw-section-view></lcw-part-view></div></lcw-unit-view>
